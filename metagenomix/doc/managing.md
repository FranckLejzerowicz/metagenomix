# Managing

If the user wants to create a pipeline with the exact same [configuration 
files](https://github.com/FranckLejzerowicz/metagenomix/wiki/Configuration) 
than one already created, but wants to change **just one single parameter 
for one single software**, then the pipeline has to be re-run, possible 
after some results are renamed.
